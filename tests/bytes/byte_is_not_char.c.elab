bytes/byte_is_not_char.c:4:14: error: constraint violation: initializing 'byte' with an expression of incompatible type 'signed int'
    byte y = 'a';

ยง6.7.9#11, sentence 2: 
11   The initializer for a scalar shall be a single expression, optionally enclosed in braces. The
     initial value of the object is that of the expression (after conversion); the same type
     constraints and conversions as for simple assignment apply, taking the type of the scalar
     to be the unqualified version of its declared type.

ยง6.5.16.1#1: 
1   One of the following shall hold:112)
    -- the left operand has atomic, qualified, or unqualified arithmetic type, and the right has
       arithmetic type;
    -- the left operand has an atomic, qualified, or unqualified version of a structure or union
       type compatible with the type of the right;
    -- the left operand has atomic, qualified, or unqualified pointer type, and (considering
       the type the left operand would have after lvalue conversion) both operands are
       pointers to qualified or unqualified versions of compatible types, and the type pointed
       to by the left has all the qualifiers of the type pointed to by the right;
    -- the left operand has atomic, qualified, or unqualified pointer type, and (considering
       the type the left operand would have after lvalue conversion) one operand is a pointer
       to an object type, and the other is a pointer to a qualified or unqualified version of
       void, and the type pointed to by the left has all the qualifiers of the type pointed to
       by the right;
    -- the left operand is an atomic, qualified, or unqualified pointer, and the right is a null
       pointer constant; or
    -- the left operand has type atomic, qualified, or unqualified _Bool, and the right is a
       pointer.

FOOTNOTE.112: 
The asymmetric appearance of these constraints with respect to type qualifiers is due to the conversion
         (specified in 6.3.2.1) that changes lvalues to ``the value of the expression'' and thus removes any type
         qualifiers that were applied to the type category of the expression (for example, it removes const but
         not volatile from the type int volatile * const).
