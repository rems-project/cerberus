[Reference description of Core]

Core is a typed language design to be the target of an elaboration of Ailτ. When
elaborating a Ailτ program into a Core program, a Ailτ expression which may
produce side effects [§5.1.2.3#2] are explicitely decomposed into:
  
  - its memory accesses
  - its pure arithmetic computations
  - pure tests deciding at runtime if an undefined behaviour occurs
  - pure tests catching static errors that need to be postpone to runtime
    because of their dependence on implementation defined behaviours.

Effectful expressions (those using or modifying the memory state) and pure
computations are segregated through typing:

  Θ ::= θ      a type for a pure computation
      | [θ]    a type for an effectful expression producing a value of
               base-type θ

where the base-types are the following:

  θ ::= integer          the set of mathematical integers (ℤ)
     |  boolean          
     |  address          locations of memory objects
     |  ctype            Ailτ types
     |  unit             
     |  (θ1, ..., θk)    


To these base types, corresponds base constructors for pure expressions:

  e ::= n
     |  true
     |  false
     |  τ
     |  skip
     |  …

Additionally we need to be able to refer to the result of effectful expressions,
like the value read by a memory load access. For this purpose Core has symbolic
names on which the value of effectful expression can be saved (using operators
detailled later):

  e ::= …
     |  α
     |  …

These symbolic names are not references but simply read-only aliases. The type
of a symbolic name is the pure type corresponding to the type of the associated
expression.

Next are the usual binary operators over integers and booleans:

  • ::= + | -              e ::= …
     |  * | / | %             |  e1 • e2
     |  = | <                 |  ¬ e
     |  ∧ | ∨                 |  let α = e1 in e2         [binds α in e2]
                              |  if e1 then e2 else e3
                              |  …

For the binary and unary operators, the operand must be pure. The same is true
for the first operand of the let and if construstors. The let constructor is one
of the binders for symbolic names but it differs from the upcommig ones in that
is binds the value of a pure expression. The second and third operands of the if
constructor may be effectful, but must have the same base type.

The language also have functions:
  
  fun f ( arg1 : θ1, ..., argk : θk) : Θ := e    [binds f, arg1, ..., argk in e]
  
  e ::= …
     |  f ( e1, ..., ek)
     |  …

which are explicitely types and may be recursive. Unlike the ones we find in
Ailτ, Core functions are not inherently effectful: temporary memory objects are
not created for passing the arguments. The arguments passed to a function must
be pure expressions and a call is therefore only performing a substitution of
these expressions into the function’s body. However the body expression of a
function may very well be effectful, in which case function calls to that
function will have an effectful type. When used to elaborate Ailτ functions,
Core functions are used but before any call, memory objects are created,
initialised to the value of the arguments and their locations are passed to the
Core function elaborating the body of the Ailτ function. At the end of the
executation of the body, these are then destroyed.

When elaborating a Ailτ program in Core, we try to make explicit as much of the
occuring undefined-behaviours as possible. For this, we have a special
constructor which can have any type and halt the execution of the Core program
when evaluated:

  e ::= …
     |  undef
     |  error
     |  …

For example, we translate the Ailτ expression 1 / x; (possibly undefined if x
equals 0), into:

  α ← load{τ} x >> if α = 0 then undef else 1 / α

This is a bit tasteless because it sort of implies that a C program with an
undefined behaviour (that is, having one execution reaching a situation the
standard declares undefined) “temporarely exists” on the valid prefix of that
execution and on the other (non malicious) execution. As a result, for a given C
program, its semantics is the elaborated Core program but only assuming this
program doesn’t have undef as a normal form. In the previous code there is also
the problem of what to do regarding the division at the Core level when 𝛼
evaluates to zero. If we make a Core division by zero produce an error, then we
have to further quotient the elaborative semantics of C and this time this is
not in term of a property of the input C program (ie. presence of a
undefined-behaviour) but in term of something internal to Core. For now I assume
that the division by zero in Core evaluates to zero.
The second constructor error is similar, but is used to signal the occurence of
a static errors that can only be (portably) detected at runtime because it
depends on implementation defined constants. An example of such error (the
only?) is when dealing with integer constants: when trying to type a constant,
the implementation starts from the smallest integer type and see if the value is
small enought (using implementation-defined kowledge) and then try with the next
smallest type. If no type is large enough, there is a typing error.

The next constructs are explicit memory actions for the elaboration of Ailτ
accesses:

  a ::= create{e}
     |  alloc e
     |  kill e
     |  store{e1} e2 e3
     |  load{e1} e2

they are the only way to interact with the memory state, and a Core can be
summarize as a trace of these actions.

  * create{e} (resp. alloc e)  corresponds to the beginning of the lifetime
    [§6.2.4#2] of an object automatically (resp. dynamically, through the use of
    functions like malloc()) allocated. For create, the argument is a pure
    expression evaluating to a Ailτ type (which are values in Core as discussed
    later) and is used to set the effective type [§6.5#6] of the object being
    created. For alloc, the argument is the amount of memory to allocate for the
    object (a pure expression evaluating to a integer). The value of these two
    memory actions is the location of the created memory object.
  
  * kill e  represents the end of the lifetime of an object, and therefore
    appears at the end of the elaboration of a Ailτ statements block. The
    argument is the memory object to kill (a pure expression evaluating to a
    memory location). The value of this action is unit.
 
  * store{e1} e2 e3  is the only way in Core to modify the value stored in a
    memory object. The first argument is the type of value being stored and is
    used at runtime to verify that this memory access is compatible with the
    effective type of the object. An undefined behaviour occurs otherwise. The
    second argument is the memory location of the object being accesses. The
    third argument is the value to be stored. The three arguments are pure
    expressions. The value of this action is unit.

  * load{e1}e2  is the counterpart of store for reading the value of memory
    object. The argument are similar to the two first argument of store, and are
    again pure expressions. The value of this action is the value being read.

[NOTE: think are changing here, J&K have been looking into enriching the type
       the actions, in particular by making the type "address" parametric on a
       Ailτ type (effective type), and have some inference of that parameter
       when typing actions.]

[NOTE2: as discussed in Knote3, in the implementation of Core, actions are now
        annotated with sets of "trace actions" to allow the reconstruction of
        C's sequence-before relation from execution traces. But this is not
        visible from the language itself]


We need to (un)sequence these actions and Core provides operators for this
purpose, allowing the C ``sequenced-before'' relation to be made explicit in the
syntax of the elaborated programs. But first we extend the actions with a
polarity that will affect the semantics of one of these operators:

  e ::= …          u ::= a     positive
     |  u             |  ~a    negative
     |  …          

Intuitively, a negative action will be an action that elaborates a Ailτ memory
access that is not part of the value computation of the expression it is part of
(e.g. the incrementing store of a postfix increment, or the store of a
assignment). It may be sufficient to only have negative stores and not the other
kind of actions, but I keep the possibility for now. However, to reflect this,
all negative actions have base type unit (e.g. a negative load has type
[unit]). If this pose problem to write the elaboration function then I'll see
that we need non-store negative actions (I won't get any information from the
other direction however).

The sequencing operators are the following:

  e ::= …
     |  e1 || ... || ek
     |  P ← e1 >> e2       [binds the symbols of P in e2]
     |  P ← e1 ; e2        [binds the symbols of P in e2]
     |  α ← a ▷ u          [binds α in u]
     |  …
  
  _P ::= _           P ::= _P
      |  ()             |  (_P1, ..., _Pk)
      |  α

[ Unsequencing operator (||) ]
  
  This operator does not introduce any sequenced-before edges between the
  actions of its subexpressions. It is used for combining the subexpressions of
  most Ailτ arithmetic and logical operators. The type of an unsequenced
  expression is the product of the types of the subexpressions. We require all
  the subexpressions to be effectful and therefore an unsequenced expression is
  always effectful. This restriction is somehow artificial, but aim at
  reflecting the fact sequencing operator only make sense when actions are
  involved. Using the unsequenced operator on pure subexpressions would simply
  correspond to having tuples, which doesn't seem to be useful (note that the
  \textsf{let} constructor only binds a symbol, while the two binding sequencing
  operators, which may have a first argument containing an unsequenced
  expressions, binds a pattern).

[ Weak sequencing operator (>>) ]

  Most operator (arithmetic, logical) in C induce an ordering between parts of
  the execution of some operand (their value computations) and the execution of
  other operand. The weak sequencing operator allows to elaborate this ordering,
  assuming the actions corresponding to C value computations are marked as
  negative by the elaboration function. This operator sequence the positive
  actions of its first operand before all the actions of its second operand, but
  no the negative ones (however since a negative action can at any time be
  rewritten into a positive one, for each negative action of the first operand
  of a weak sequencing operator, there exists an execution where that action is
  sequence-before the second operand). Similarly to the unsequencing operator,
  the first operand must be effectful since sequencing a pure expression doesn't
  mean anything. As the first operand may contain an unsequenced expression,
  this operator binds to a list of symbolic names.

[ Strong sequencing operator (;) ]

  

[ Atomic sequencing operator (▷) ]

  




e ::= …
   |  [e]      indeterminately sequenced (indet) expression
   |  ▶ e ◀    boundary for the scope of indet expressions
   |  …



e ::= …
   |  same e1 e2
   |  …












Coming back to the difference between Ailτ and Core function calls, consider the
following Ailτ expression: f(1 - x, 2);. Here the two subexpressions are
evaluated unsequenced (doesn't matter here since only one is effectful), then
two temporary memory objects are created and initialised to the value of the
subexpressions. The function f() is then passed these two objects as arguments
and run. Once the execution of the function is completed, the temporary objects
are destroyed. Translating these in Core, we get:

  (α1, α2) ← (α ← load{τ} x >> 1 - α) || 2      >>
  (α3, α4) ← create{τ1} || create{τ2}           >>
             store{τ1} α1 α3 || store{τ1} α2 α4 ;
  α5       ← f(α3, α4)                          >>
             kill α3 || kill α4                 >>
             α5
