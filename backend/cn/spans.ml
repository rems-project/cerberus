(* The standard span logic for a model, request and resource context is:
   (1) Compute spans for all existing and requested resources.
   (2) Subtract from the request spans the spans of existing resources of
       the same type. Such resources can already be handled by the resource
       inference and are preferred. This avoids a silly case where overlapping
       resources in the context create a problem.
   (3) If the remaining request spans intersect with a different-typed resource,
       something needs to be decomposed. If the context resource is larger,
       unpack it. If the request is larger, attempt to pack the requested
       thing. That pack operation recurses into requests for the components
       (i.e. splitting up the request). The request will be reattempted with
       the packed/unpacked resource in the context. In the packing case, this
       will be a same-typed resource shrinking the request span according to (2).
       - structs/arrays with one element, and resource predicates, count as
         larger than their contents, even if they're the same size.
       - if neither object is larger, but they're different, we need to split
         at both ends. start with the context resource. this happens e.g. if a
         resource needs to be unpacked out of one predicate type and packed
         again in another.
       - for an outer iterated array, operate on the element that intersects
         with the relevant inner object.
       - for an inner iterated array, require a witness that the array is nonempty
         and proceed based on it. multiple potential witnesses may be needed to deal
         with a tricky case involving missing elements of variable index.
   (4) If the request, in this model, is a resource predicate where the
       relevant clause claims no resources, then pack it. Only do this if
       there is no pointer-matching resource in the context.


FIXME: the above appeals (repeatedly) to the idea that overlapping same-resouce
spans can be subtracted in (2). This broadly makes sense, but specifically might
happen because of some coincidence in the current model. Perhaps an additional
check could be done. It's clear what this should be for "concrete" Owned/Owned
overlaps, but for overlaps involving arrays at partly-dynamic offsets, it's all
a bit complicated. To be revisited.
